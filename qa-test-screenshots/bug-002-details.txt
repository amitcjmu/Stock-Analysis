BUG #2: Assessment API Call Missing Required Multi-Tenant Headers (400 Error)

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Description
When the assessment page loads, it attempts to fetch unmapped assets but fails with a 400 Bad Request error because the frontend is not including required multi-tenant security headers (X-Client-Account-Id and X-Engagement-Id).

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Login with demo@demo-corp.com / Demo123!
2. Navigate to Collection > Overview
3. Click "View Progress" on active collection flow
4. Click "Start Assessment Phase"
5. Observe browser console error: "Failed to fetch unmapped assets: Error: HTTP 400: Bad Request"

## Expected Behavior
- Frontend should include X-Client-Account-Id and X-Engagement-Id headers in all API calls
- Backend should successfully return unmapped assets data
- No 400 errors in console

## Actual Behavior
- Frontend makes API call WITHOUT multi-tenant headers ✗
- Backend returns 400 Bad Request ✗
- Browser console shows error ✗

## Backend Log Evidence
```
Context extraction failed for /api/v1/collection/assessment/55610227.../unmapped-assets:
403: Client account context is required for multi-tenant security.
Please provide X-Client-Account-Id header.
Status: 400
```

## URL
http://localhost:8081/assessment/55610227-7481-45e5-87ff-dc776dd8d5f8/architecture

## Potential Root Cause
- Frontend API service not properly configured to include multi-tenant headers
- Missing header injection in React Query configuration
- Inconsistent API client usage across different pages

## Impact
- Assessment page cannot load application data
- Users stuck on "No applications loaded yet" message
- Complete blocker for assessment phase workflow
- Violates multi-tenant security requirements (CRITICAL security issue per CLAUDE.md)
