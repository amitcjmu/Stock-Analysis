BUG #4: Assessment Master Flow Created Without Child Flow (Two-Table Pattern Violation)

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Description
The assessment flow transition creates a master flow in `crewai_flow_state_extensions` but fails to create the corresponding child flow in `assessment_flows`. This violates the mandatory two-table pattern architecture (ADR-012) and causes the UI to fail when trying to display assessment data.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Login with demo@demo-corp.com / Demo123!
2. Navigate to Collection > Overview
3. Click "View Progress" then "Start Assessment Phase"
4. Check database for assessment flows

## Expected Behavior
- Both master flow AND child flow should be created atomically
- `crewai_flow_state_extensions` should have master entry
- `assessment_flows` should have child entry with matching master_flow_id
- UI should display assessment data from child flow

## Actual Behavior
- Master flow created: flow_id=55610227-7481-45e5-87ff-dc776dd8d5f8, type=assessment ✓
- Child flow NOT created in assessment_flows ✗
- UI shows "No applications loaded yet" ✗
- Frontend has no child flow data to display ✗

## Database Evidence
```sql
-- Master Flow Exists
SELECT flow_id, flow_type, flow_status
FROM migration.crewai_flow_state_extensions
WHERE flow_id='55610227-7481-45e5-87ff-dc776dd8d5f8'::uuid;

Result:
flow_id: 55610227-7481-45e5-87ff-dc776dd8d5f8
flow_type: assessment
flow_status: initialized

-- Child Flow MISSING
SELECT id, master_flow_id, current_phase, status, progress
FROM migration.assessment_flows
WHERE master_flow_id='55610227-7481-45e5-87ff-dc776dd8d5f8'::uuid;

Result: (0 rows)  ← NO CHILD FLOW!
```

http://localhost:8081/assessment/55610227-7481-45e5-87ff-dc776dd8d5f8/architecture

## Architectural Impact
This violates **ADR-012: Flow Status Management Separation**:
- Master Flow: High-level lifecycle (running, paused, completed)
- Child Flow: Operational decisions (phases, validations, UI state)
- **Frontend MUST use child flow status for decisions**

When only master flow exists without child flow:
- Frontend cannot query child flow data → UI breaks
- No operational state available → phases cannot progress
- No phase_results, agent_insights, or user_inputs stored
- UI displays "No applications loaded" indefinitely

## Potential Root Cause
Per coding-agent-guide.md "Missing Child Records & MFO Atomicity":
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Creating only master flow
master_flow = create_master_flow()
await db.commit()

# ✅ CORRECT - Atomic pattern
async with db.begin():
    master_flow_id = await orchestrator.create_flow(...)
    await db.flush()  # Makes ID available for child

    child_flow = AssessmentFlow(
        master_flow_id=master_flow_id,
        ...
    )
    db.add(child_flow)
    await db.commit()  # Single commit for both
```

## Impact
- **BLOCKER**: Assessment phase completely unusable
- Users cannot proceed with assessment workflow
- Data loss: No place to store assessment phase data
- UI permanently stuck on "No applications loaded"
- Violates enterprise architecture pattern (ADR-012)
