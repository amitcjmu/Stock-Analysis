BUG #1: Collection Flow Shows "Complete" But Database Shows "Running" with 42.86% Progress

## Severity: CRITICAL

## Description
The Collection Progress Monitor page displays "Collection Complete" and offers to "Start Assessment Phase", but the database clearly shows the collection flow is still running with only 42.86% completion.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Login with demo@demo-corp.com / Demo123!
2. Navigate to Collection > Overview
3. Click "View Progress" on the active collection flow alert
4. Observe "Collection Complete" message

## Expected Behavior
- UI should show "Collection In Progress" with 42.86% completion
- "Start Assessment Phase" button should be disabled
- Current phase "questionnaire_generation" should be displayed

## Actual Behavior
- UI shows "Collection Complete" ✗
- Button "Start Assessment Phase" is enabled ✗
- No indication that collection is still running ✗

## Database Evidence
```sql
-- Collection Flow (Child)
flow_id: 2799fbfc-4ee7-4325-b906-51852c0af67c
master_flow_id: 1666112b-ae6d-454e-b6f3-7f4944f0e45f
current_phase: questionnaire_generation
status: running
progress_percentage: 42.857142857142854

-- Master Flow
flow_id: 1666112b-ae6d-454e-b6f3-7f4944f0e45f
flow_type: collection
flow_status: running
```

## URL
http://localhost:8081/collection/progress/2799fbfc-4ee7-4325-b906-51852c0af67c

## Potential Root Cause
- Frontend is not properly checking flow status from backend
- Backend readiness endpoint may be returning incorrect "ready" state
- State synchronization issue between master and child flows

## Impact
- Users may proceed to assessment with incomplete collection data
- Data integrity issues in assessment phase
- Confusing user experience
