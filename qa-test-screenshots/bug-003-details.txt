BUG #3: Assessment Phase "initialization" Not Found in Config (Repeated Warnings)

## Severity: MEDIUM

## Description
The backend repeatedly logs warnings that the 'initialization' phase is not found in the assessment configuration. This occurs every 5 seconds during polling.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Login with demo@demo-corp.com / Demo123!
2. Navigate to Collection > Overview
3. Click "View Progress" then "Start Assessment Phase"
4. Check backend logs

## Expected Behavior
- Assessment config should include all valid phases including 'initialization'
- No repeated warnings in logs
- Smooth phase progression

## Actual Behavior
- Backend logs repeated warning: "Phase 'initialization' not found in assessment config" ✗
- Warning appears every ~5 seconds during status polling ✗
- Flow status shows "INITIALIZED" but backend doesn't recognize this phase ✗

## Backend Log Evidence
```
2025-10-17 15:36:01,420 - app.api.v1.master_flows.assessment.list_status_endpoints - WARNING - Phase 'initialization' not found in assessment config
2025-10-17 15:36:01,495 - app.api.v1.master_flows.assessment.list_status_endpoints - WARNING - Phase 'initialization' not found in assessment config
2025-10-17 15:36:04,897 - app.api.v1.master_flows.assessment.list_status_endpoints - WARNING - Phase 'initialization' not found in assessment config
```

## Database Evidence
```sql
flow_id: 55610227-7481-45e5-87ff-dc776dd8d5f8
flow_type: assessment
flow_status: initialized
```

## Potential Root Cause
- Assessment flow configuration missing 'initialization' phase definition
- Mismatch between flow status values and configured phases
- Incomplete phase definition in assessment flow config

## Impact
- Log pollution with repeated warnings
- Potential phase progression issues
- May cause incorrect phase status reporting to frontend
- Could block automated phase transitions
