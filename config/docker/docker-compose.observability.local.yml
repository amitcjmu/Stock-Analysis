# Local Development Observability Override
# Purpose: Override settings for macOS/Windows local development
# Usage: docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.observability.yml -f docker-compose.observability.local.yml --env-file .env.observability up -d
#
# Key Differences from Production (Azure/Railway):
# 1. Alloy runs as root (workaround for macOS Docker socket permissions)
# 2. Init containers disabled (not needed for local dev)
# 3. Simplified volume permissions

services:
  # Override Alloy to run as root for Docker socket access on macOS
  alloy:
    user: "0:0"  # Run as root - LOCAL DEV ONLY, NOT FOR PRODUCTION
    environment:
      - ALLOY_ENVIRONMENT=local
