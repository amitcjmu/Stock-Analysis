# Cursor Agent Rules - AI Modernize Migration Platform

## 🚨 MANDATORY FIRST STEP - READ BEFORE ANY WORK

**ALL CURSOR AGENTS MUST READ THIS DOCUMENT FIRST:**

`docs/development/CODING_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_SUMMARY.md`

This document contains:
- Critical architecture patterns (MFO two-table flow ID pattern, async database patterns, etc.)
- Common bug patterns and fixes from 300+ Serena memories
- Testing, security, and database patterns
- Agent orchestration patterns
- Development workflow patterns

**Why this is critical:**
- Prevents recurring bugs that have been fixed before
- Ensures alignment with established architectural patterns
- Provides context from 300+ previous development sessions
- Contains top 10 critical patterns that must be understood before code changes

## Additional Required Reading

Before beginning work, agents should also be familiar with:
- `docs/development/AI_Force_Migration_Platform_Summary_for_Coding_Agents.md` - Current platform architecture
- `docs/analysis/Notes/000-lessons.md` - Critical lessons learned
- `docs/analysis/Notes/coding-agent-guide.md` - Coding agent guidelines

## Workflow

1. **FIRST**: Read `docs/development/CODING_AGENT_KNOWLEDGE_SUMMARY.md` completely
2. **SECOND**: Review the specific section relevant to your task
3. **THEN**: Begin implementation following the patterns documented

## Key Principles

- This is an **AGENTIC-FIRST platform** - use CrewAI agents, not hard-coded rules
- **Docker-First Development** - all work happens in containers
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture** - all data access must be client account scoped
- **Modular Service Design** - follow the handler pattern
- **Always update CHANGELOG.md** after completing tasks
