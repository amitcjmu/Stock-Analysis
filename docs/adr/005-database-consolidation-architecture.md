# ADR-005: Database Consolidation Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The AI Modernize Migration Platform database currently operates with a **dual session/flow-based architecture** that creates architectural confusion and data duplication. The system has evolved through multiple phases but lacks a unified flow coordination system across all migration phases (discovery, assessment, planning, execution).

### Current State Problems:

1. **Dual Asset Systems**
   - `assets` table (264KB): Session-based, 74 enterprise columns
   - `discovery_assets` table (304KB): Flow-based, limited scope
   - **Result**: Data duplication, architectural confusion

2. **Incomplete Flow Architecture**
   - `discovery_flows`: Discovery phase only
   - `crewai_flow_state_extensions`: Currently discovery-specific but designed as master
   - **Missing**: assessment_flows, planning_flows, execution_flows tables
   - **Result**: No cross-phase flow coordination

3. **Foreign Key Fragmentation**
   - Multiple tables referencing both `session_id` and `discovery_flow_id`
   - No universal master flow reference
   - **Result**: Complex queries, phase-isolation issues

4. **Legacy System Dependencies**
   - 5 tables tied to session-based architecture
   - Session-based audit trails and processing steps
   - **Result**: Technical debt and maintenance overhead

## Decision
We will consolidate the database from a **dual session/flow-based architecture** to a **unified flow-only architecture**. This consolidation establishes `crewai_flow_state_extensions` as the **master flow coordinator** across all phases (discovery, assessment, planning, execution), with phase-specific flow tables referencing the master flow ID.

### Target Architecture

#### Core Principles:

1. **Master Flow Coordination**: `crewai_flow_state_extensions.flow_id` as universal master flow ID
2. **Phase-Specific Tables**: Each phase has its own flow table referencing master
3. **Unified Asset Management**: Enhanced `assets` table with multi-phase flow references
4. **Enterprise-First**: Preserve all 74 enterprise asset management columns
5. **Agent-Centric**: Full integration with CrewAI agent intelligence across all phases

#### Master Flow Architecture:

**1. CrewAI Flow State Extensions as Master Coordinator**
```sql
-- MASTER: crewai_flow_state_extensions
flow_id UUID  -- Master CrewAI Flow ID (universal across all phases)
current_phase VARCHAR(50)  -- 'discovery', 'assessment', 'planning', 'execution'
phase_flow_id UUID  -- References current phase's specific flow table

-- PHASE TABLES: All reference master flow
discovery_flows.crewai_flow_id → crewai_flow_state_extensions.flow_id
assessment_flows.crewai_flow_id → crewai_flow_state_extensions.flow_id (Future)
planning_flows.crewai_flow_id → crewai_flow_state_extensions.flow_id (Future)
execution_flows.crewai_flow_id → crewai_flow_state_extensions.flow_id (Future)
```

**2. Multi-Phase Asset Management**
```sql
-- Enhanced assets table with multi-phase flow references
assets.master_flow_id → crewai_flow_state_extensions.flow_id (PRIMARY)
assets.discovery_flow_id → discovery_flows.id (PHASE-SPECIFIC)
assets.assessment_flow_id → assessment_flows.id (FUTURE)
assets.planning_flow_id → planning_flows.id (FUTURE)
```

**3. Data Integration Transformation**
```sql
BEFORE: data_imports → session_id
AFTER:  data_imports → master_flow_id (crewai_flow_state_extensions.flow_id)

BEFORE: raw_import_records → session_id  
AFTER:  raw_import_records → master_flow_id

BEFORE: import_field_mappings → data_import_id
AFTER:  import_field_mappings → master_flow_id

BEFORE: access_audit_log → session_id
AFTER:  access_audit_log → master_flow_id
```

## Implementation

### Single Migration Approach

Execute as one comprehensive migration rather than phased approach due to:
- Current data is primarily test data
- Clean break from session-based architecture
- Establishes proper master flow architecture
- Enables future phase implementation

### Data Migration Plan

**Phase 1: Master Flow Architecture**
- Enhance `crewai_flow_state_extensions` as master flow coordinator
- Add phase tracking and flow coordination columns
- Create proper master flow indexes

**Phase 2: Asset Table Enhancement**
- Add master flow reference to `assets` table
- Add multi-phase flow references for future scalability
- Migrate `discovery_assets` data to enhanced `assets` table

**Phase 3: Data Integration Updates**
- Update all data integration tables to reference master flow
- Remove session-based references
- Establish proper flow-based data lineage

**Phase 4: Cleanup**
- Drop legacy session-based tables
- Remove redundant discovery_assets table
- Update application layer to use master flow architecture

### Table Classification

**Enhanced Tables (2)**
```
crewai_flow_state_extensions - Enhanced as master flow coordinator
├── Existing: CrewAI flow analytics and performance tracking
├── Added: Phase coordination, flow progression tracking
└── Result: Universal master flow reference across all phases

assets - Enhanced with multi-phase flow capabilities
├── Existing: 74 enterprise asset management columns
├── Added: Master flow + phase-specific flow references
└── Result: Single source of truth with cross-phase flow tracking
```

**Transformed Tables (4)**
```
data_imports - Remove session_id, add master_flow_id
raw_import_records - Remove session_id, add master_flow_id  
import_field_mappings - Remove data_import_id, add master_flow_id
access_audit_log - Remove session_id, add master_flow_id
```

**Preserved Tables (41)**
```
Core Infrastructure: client_accounts, engagements, users, user_roles
Discovery System: discovery_flows (enhanced with master flow reference)
Asset Ecosystem: asset_dependencies, asset_embeddings, asset_tags
Migration System: migrations, migration_waves, assessments
Analysis System: sixr_analyses, feedback, llm_usage_logs
Supporting: All other enterprise and system tables
```

**Removed Tables (5)**
```
discovery_assets - Merged into enhanced assets table
data_import_sessions - Replaced by master flow architecture
workflow_states - Replaced by discovery_flows + master flow
import_processing_steps - Redundant processing tracking
data_quality_issues - Moved to discovery_flows.agent_insights
```

**Future Scalability (Planned)**
```
assessment_flows - Assessment phase flows (references master_flow_id)
planning_flows - Planning phase flows (references master_flow_id)
execution_flows - Execution phase flows (references master_flow_id)
modernization_flows - Modernization phase flows (references master_flow_id)
```

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Phased Migration Approach**: Rejected due to complexity of maintaining dual systems during transition
2. **Keep Dual Asset Systems**: Rejected due to ongoing maintenance overhead and architectural confusion
3. **Session-Based Architecture**: Rejected as it doesn't align with CrewAI flow patterns and creates synchronization issues

This architectural decision establishes a robust master flow coordination system that enables seamless cross-phase migration lifecycle management while preserving enterprise asset management capabilities and establishing patterns for future phase implementation.
