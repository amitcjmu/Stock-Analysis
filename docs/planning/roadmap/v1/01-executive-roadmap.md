# AI Modernize Migration Platform
## Enterprise Product Roadmap 2025-2026

### Executive Summary

The AI Modernize Migration Platform stands at a critical juncture. With 98% production readiness and proven AI orchestration capabilities, we have a unique opportunity to capture the $2.3B cloud migration market. However, immediate action is required to address single-developer risk, technical debt, and enterprise scalability requirements.

This roadmap outlines our path from current state to $30M ARR by Q4 2026, focusing on three strategic pillars:
1. **Platform Stabilization & Team Scaling** (Q1-Q2 2025)
2. **Enterprise Hardening & Market Entry** (Q3-Q4 2025)
3. **Scale & Ecosystem Expansion** (Q1-Q4 2026)
