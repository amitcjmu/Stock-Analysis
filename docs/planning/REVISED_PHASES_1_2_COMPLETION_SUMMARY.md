## 🏆 **Critical Corrections Made**

### **Major Inaccuracies Fixed**

#### **1. "Phase 1 Migration Complete" → "Remediation Phase 1 (75% Complete)"**
- **Impact**: Prevents developer confusion about current state
- **Reality**: 6-8 weeks of foundation work remaining
- **Evidence**: 132+ files still have session_id references

#### **2. "API v3 Primary, v1/v2 Deprecated" → "Mixed v1/v3 During Transition"**
- **Impact**: Matches actual frontend usage patterns
- **Reality**: Frontend still primarily uses v1 API
- **Evidence**: Codebase analysis shows mixed usage

#### **3. "Session ID Migration Complete" → "25% Complete, Widespread Cleanup Needed"**
- **Impact**: Sets realistic expectations for remaining work
- **Reality**: Systematic file-by-file cleanup required
- **Evidence**: Extensive session_id references throughout codebase

#### **4. "PostgreSQL-Only Achieved" → "PostgreSQL-Only Achieved (Verified)"**
- **Impact**: Confirms one major success while acknowledging other work
- **Reality**: This migration was actually completed successfully
- **Evidence**: No SQLite references found in current codebase
