4. Backup Testing
   Severity: LOW
   CVSS Score: 2.8
   Description: Automated backup restoration testing not implemented
   Impact: Potential backup integrity issues
   Recommendation: Implement automated backup validation

5. Container Registry Security
   Severity: LOW
   CVSS Score: 2.5
   Description: Container images not stored in private registry
   Impact: Minimal - using standard public images
   Recommendation: Consider private container registry for production
