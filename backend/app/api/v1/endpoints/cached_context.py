Cached Context API Endpoints
Simplified version with modularized components.

Enhanced context endpoints with Redis caching, ETag support, and conditional requests.
These endpoints demonstrate the integration of the CacheMiddleware with real API operations.

🔒 Security: Multi-tenant isolation, secure caching, audit logging
⚡ Performance: Redis caching, ETag support, optimized queries
🎯 Coherence: Cache invalidation integration, real-time updates
📊 Analytics: Cache metrics, performance monitoring
