Unified Discovery Handlers Package

This package contains modular handlers for unified discovery operations following
the established architectural patterns for handler-based modularity.

Each handler implements specific discovery operations with:
- Tenant isolation (client_account_id, engagement_id)
- Defensive programming practices
- Proper error handling and logging
- Fallback logic for resilience
