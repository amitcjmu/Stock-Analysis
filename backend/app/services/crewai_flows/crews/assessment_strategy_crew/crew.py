Assessment Strategy Crew - Main Crew Implementation

PHASE 6 MIGRATION (October 2025): Migrated from SixRStrategyCrew
This crew provides 6R recommendation logic for Assessment Flow.

This module contains the main AssessmentStrategyCrew class that orchestrates
component-level 6R strategy determination with validation and wave planning.

The crew determines optimal migration strategies for each component based on
technical characteristics, business constraints, and integration requirements.

Key Responsibilities:
- Determine optimal 6R strategy for each application component
- Validate compatibility between component treatments within applications
- Generate move group hints for Planning Flow wave coordination
- Assess business value, effort, and risk factors for each strategy
- Provide confidence scoring and detailed rationale for decisions

The crew consists of three specialized agents:
1. Component Modernization Strategist - Determines optimal 6R strategy per component
2. Architecture Compatibility Validator - Validates treatment compatibility
3. Migration Wave Planning Advisor - Provides move group hints for Planning Flow

MIGRATION NOTES:
- Renamed from SixRStrategyCrew to AssessmentStrategyCrew
- Works with Assessment model (MFO-integrated), not deprecated SixRAnalysis
- Integrated with Assessment Flow state management
