"""
TTL Manager for Auth Performance Optimization

This module implements dynamic TTL (Time-To-Live) management for cache entries including:
- Dynamic TTL calculation based on data type, usage patterns, and system load
- Background refresh scheduling to prevent cache misses
- Predictive refresh based on access patterns and trends
- Cache warming for frequently accessed data
- Adaptive TTL based on system performance metrics

The TTL manager optimizes cache performance by ensuring hot data stays cached
while allowing cold data to expire naturally, reducing memory usage and
improving overall system performance.

🔒 Security: Multi-tenant isolation and secure TTL management
⚡ Performance: Optimized background refresh with minimal system impact
🎯 Coherence: Coordinated TTL management across cache layers
📊 Analytics: Comprehensive TTL metrics and optimization tracking
