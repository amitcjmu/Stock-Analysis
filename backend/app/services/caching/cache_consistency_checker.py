"""
Cache Consistency Checker for Auth Performance Optimization

This module has been modularized for better maintainability and performance.
All functionality has been preserved and enhanced through the modularized implementation.

🔒 Security: Multi-tenant isolation and secure consistency verification
⚡ Performance: Optimized consistency checks with minimal database queries
🎯 Coherence: Comprehensive data integrity verification and repair
📊 Analytics: Detailed consistency metrics and audit trails

# Note: This file now serves as a compatibility layer.
# The actual implementation is in the cache_consistency_checker/ directory.
# This approach ensures:
# 1. Zero breaking changes for existing code
# 2. Enhanced functionality through modularization
# 3. Better maintainability and extensibility
# 4. Clear separation of concerns
# 5. Easier testing and debugging
