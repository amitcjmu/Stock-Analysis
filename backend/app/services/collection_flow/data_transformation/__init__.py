Data Transformation and Normalization Services Module

This module provides services for transforming raw collected data into
normalized formats and ensuring data consistency across different platforms.

This is a modularized version of the original data_transformation.py file.
All existing imports continue to work unchanged for backward compatibility.

IMPORTANT: This preserves all original APIs and functionality.

Key Features:
- Field mapping and renaming for standardization
- Value conversions and formatting across platforms
- Data structure transformations for consistency
- Complex rule-based transformations
- Value standardization (status values, boolean conversions)
- Unit conversions (storage sizes, memory)
- Format standardization (dates, hostnames)
- Data deduplication and consolidation
