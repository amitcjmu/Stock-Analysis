"""
Cache Models Package

This package contains SQLAlchemy models for tracking cache operations, performance metrics,
and coherence in the Redis caching layer. All models follow the established patterns
from the existing codebase including multi-tenant isolation and proper foreign keys.

🔒 Security: All models include client_account_id for multi-tenant isolation
⚡ Performance: Optimized indexes for cache lookup and analytics queries
🎯 Coherence: Support for cascade invalidation tracking
📊 Analytics: Built-in performance metrics and audit trails
