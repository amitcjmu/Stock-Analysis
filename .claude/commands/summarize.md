#Prompt for Troubleshooting Session Summary

Please provide a concise, structured summary of all key learnings, insights, and important details from our entire troubleshooting session to serve as context for the next agent. The summary should enable seamless continuation of troubleshooting by focusing on the following:

**Topics Discussed:** Summarize the main issues, components, or functionalities addressed during troubleshooting (e.g., specific app features, APIs, or database interactions).
Code Modifications: List all code changes made, including:
Files or modules modified.
Specific lines or sections altered (if applicable).
Purpose of each change (e.g., bug fix, performance optimization).
Any temporary workarounds or patches applied.


**Patterns Identified:**
Patterns to use: Describe coding practices, configurations, or approaches that resolved issues or improved functionality (e.g., specific error handling techniques or library usage).
Patterns to avoid: Highlight practices, configurations, or approaches that caused issues or were ineffective (e.g., deprecated methods or incompatible dependencies).


**User Preferences and Requirements:** Note any specific preferences (e.g., programming language version, framework, or performance priorities) or requirements mentioned (e.g., compatibility with specific platforms).
Critical Outcomes and Decisions: Detail resolved issues, unresolved issues, and any key decisions made (e.g., choosing to refactor a module or defer a fix).
Lessons Learned: Highlight insights that prevent the next agent from relearning or repeating efforts, such as:
Known bugs or limitations in the app or its dependencies.
Environmental or configuration-specific issues (e.g., OS, version mismatches).
Effective debugging strategies or tools used.


**Next Steps:** Suggest specific areas to investigate or actions to take based on the current state of troubleshooting.

Format the summary as a clear, bulleted list or structured sections for easy parsing by the next agent. Exclude redundant or irrelevant details, and ensure technical accuracy in describing code changes and patterns.
